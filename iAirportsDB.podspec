  s.description      = <<-DESC
Airports, heliports, seaplane bases, and balloonports can quickly be found near a location or by identifier. Supporting information such as runways and frequencies are provided. Information is global. The library is Swift but Objective C is supported. Behind the scenes Core Data using sqlite provides the framework for fast lookups.
